### What is this?
> This is our entry for the [Pursuing Pixels James Jam Game Gam #3](https://itch.io/jam/pursuing-pixels-james-jam-game-gam-3) event on itch.io. It's a 2D, point-and-click pixel game that simulates the job of an office-worker who has way too many things on their plate. Not only do they have to answer phone calls and send out emails, but they have to constantly fight a computer virus and hand documents to their pesky coworkers... all at the same time!

### Why?
> We participated in the jam to expose ourselves to the Godot game engine, learn new game development techniques, and have fun. On the day of the jam, we were given the theme prompt of *parallel*, which our game had to adhere to in some way. We brainstormed a bit and decided we wanted to capture the feeling of doing multiple tasks in parallel, to which an office setting sounded fitting. 

### How can I play?
